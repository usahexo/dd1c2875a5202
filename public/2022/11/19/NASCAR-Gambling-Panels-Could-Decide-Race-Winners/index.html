        <h1 id="NASCAR-Gambling-Panels-Could-Decide-Race-Winners"><a href="#NASCAR-Gambling-Panels-Could-Decide-Race-Winners" class="headerlink" title="NASCAR Gambling Panels Could Decide Race Winners"></a>NASCAR Gambling Panels Could Decide Race Winners</h1><p>NASCAR officials are reportedly considering a rule change that would have race panelists instead of drivers determine the winner in the event of a tie.</p>
<p>The proposed change is in response to two recent races that ended in ties after 400 laps. The first, at Phoenix International Raceway on March 18, was won by Ryan Newman after the tie-breaking vote went to him over Kyle Busch. The second, at Talladega Superspeedway on May 6, was won by Brad Keselowski after the tie-breaking vote went to him over Kyle Busch and Denny Hamlin.</p>
<p>In both instances, Newman and Keselowski were the last drivers remaining in the tie-breaker round of voting. In order to break future ties, NASCAR officials are reportedly considering implementing a rule that would have a three-person panel consisting of one representative from NASCAR, one from the Drivers Council, and one neutral party cast the deciding vote.</p>
<p>“I can’t say we haven’t talked about it, because we have,” said Jim Cassidy, NASCAR senior vice president of racing operations. “But I also can’t say that we’ve come up with a solution that is 100 percent satisfactory yet. We continue to look at it because we know it’s important to our fans and our sport. We want to make sure we do everything possible to give them a fair finish.”</p>
<p>The proposed rule change has been met with mixed reactions from drivers. Some feel that it takes away some of their control over the outcome of the race while others feel that it is simply another way for NASCAR to ensure that there is a clear winner.</p>
<p>“As a competitor you want to be able to win or lose on your own merits,” said Dale Earnhardt Jr., who is on the Drivers Council.”But I also understand there is appeal in having an objective third party stepping in and making a decision if it’s too close to call.”</p>
<p>No timetable has been set for when a decision might be made on the proposed rule change.</p>
<h1 id="NASCAR-Gambling-Panels-to-Get-Rid-of-Pit-Road-speeding-Penalties"><a href="#NASCAR-Gambling-Panels-to-Get-Rid-of-Pit-Road-speeding-Penalties" class="headerlink" title="NASCAR Gambling Panels to Get Rid of Pit Road speeding Penalties"></a>NASCAR Gambling Panels to Get Rid of Pit Road speeding Penalties</h1><p>NASCAR gambling panels will now dish out penalties for drivers who exceed the pit road speed limit, instead of the crew chief and car owner.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a way to offset some of the damage done by last year’s rule change which limited crew chiefs to just two boxes of tires per race. That alteration made it more difficult for crews to make adjustments during pit stops, increasing the chances of drivers exceeding the speed limit.</p>
<p>NASCAR vice president Steve O’Donnell says that “the pit road penalty will now be on the driver. The responsibility falls on them to make sure they get through pit road safely and under the speed limit.”</p>
<p>If a driver is found to have exceeded the speed limit after a race, they will be docked points, fined and possibly suspended from future races. Crew chiefs and team owners will still be held liable for pit road speeding infractions during races, but any penalties handed down will now be less severe.</p>
<p>The move is being seen as a way to put more emphasis on driver safety, while also making it more difficult for teams to gain an advantage over their opponents. NASCAR has been struggling in recent years to keep fans interested in the sport, and this latest rule change could help to bring some excitement back to the track.</p>
<h1 id="NASCAR-Gambler’s-Panel-Set-Up-to-Reduce-Penalties"><a href="#NASCAR-Gambler’s-Panel-Set-Up-to-Reduce-Penalties" class="headerlink" title="NASCAR Gambler’s Panel Set Up to Reduce Penalties"></a>NASCAR Gambler’s Panel Set Up to Reduce Penalties</h1><p>The NASCAR Gamble Association has been in the works for a few months and is now ready to launch. The goal of the Gamble Association is to provide a fair and unbiased panel to hear appeals on penalties against drivers, car owners, and crews. This will help reduce penalties that seem to be handed out at random by NASCAR officials.</p>
<p>The Gamble Association will have a board of directors that includes experienced drivers, car owners, and crew chiefs. This board will review each penalty appeal and make a fair decision based on the facts of the case. Officials from NASCAR will also be able to attend these meetings to provide their side of the story.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for forming this group is the recent penalty against Martin Truex Jr. and his team. NASCAR fined them $200,000 and docked them 50 points for a violation that occurred at Sonoma Raceway. There was some confusion over what the violation was, and many people felt that the punishment was too harsh.</p>
<p>The Gamble Association will help ensure that decisions like this are made fairly and without bias. This group is also open to anyone who wants to join, including fans and journalists.

<h1 id="NASCAR-adopts-gambling-panel-to-monitor-races"><a href="#NASCAR-adopts-gambling-panel-to-monitor-races" class="headerlink" title="NASCAR adopts gambling panel to monitor races"></a>NASCAR adopts gambling panel to monitor races</h1><p>NASCAR announced this week that it will form a six-person gambling oversight panel to monitor race situations and identify potential gambling opportunities. The NASCAR Executive Committee unanimously approved the decision, which comes in the wake of several high-profile instances of cheating in the sport.</p>
<p>“The integrity of our sport is paramount, and we have a responsibility to ensure that it is protected at all times,” said NASCAR Chairman Jim France.</p>
<p>The new panel will be chaired by France and include former FBI Director Louis Freeh, retired Army General Stanley McChrystal, and casino executive Mitch Garber. The other members are yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Gambling on NASCAR races has become increasingly popular in recent years, with online sportsbooks offering betting opportunities on everything from who will win to what order the top ten drivers will finish. In some cases, entire races can be wagered on.</p>
<p>The formation of the gambling oversight panel comes as something of a surprise given NASCAR’s reluctance to engage with gambling in the past. The organization has long held that gambling presents a threat to the integrity of its sport. In 2002, NASCAR barred its drivers from appearing in commercials for casinos.</p>
<p>Some insiders see the formation of the new panel as a sign that NASCAR is growing increasingly comfortable with gambling and is looking to find ways to make it more profitable. After all, if people are going to bet on races anyway, why not take a cut of the action?</p>
<p>Others see it as a cynical ploy to deflect attention from the sport’s mounting corruption scandals. In May, NASCAR handed down penalties totaling $100 million to 11 teams after an investigation found that they had used illegal performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

<h1 id="NASCAR-establishes-gambling-panel-to-improve-competition"><a href="#NASCAR-establishes-gambling-panel-to-improve-competition" class="headerlink" title="NASCAR establishes gambling panel to improve competition"></a>NASCAR establishes gambling panel to improve competition</h1><p>NASCAR announced the formation of a new panel to study gambling and ways it can improve competition.</p>
<p>The panel, which includes executives from casinos and race tracks, will advise NASCAR on issues such as how to integrate legalized gambling into the sport and develop policies that protect the integrity of races.</p>
<p>“This is an important step for NASCAR as we continue to explore ways to improve competition and grow our fan base,” said NASCAR CEO Brian France.</p>
<p>Panel members include Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International; Dennis Durbin, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Dover Motorsports, Inc.; Philippe de Weck, Partner at Opsis LLC; and Tad Wesolowski, President of Plainridge Park Casino.</p>
<p>“We are excited to have this distinguished group of panelists who will provide valuable insights on how best to capitalize on the growth of legalized sports betting and its potential impact on NASCAR fans and stakeholders,” France said.</p>
