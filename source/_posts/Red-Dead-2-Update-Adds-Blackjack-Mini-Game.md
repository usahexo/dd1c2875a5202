#  Blackjack Mini-Game Now Available In Red Dead 2

In the Red Dead Redemption 2 game, Rockstar Games has added a blackjack mini-game. This mini-game is playable at any time in the game and can be accessed through the main menu.

The blackjack mini-game is a simplified version of the card game, blackjack. In blackjack, the aim of the game is to score 21 points or to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The player is dealt two cards and must decide whether to hit (draw another card) or stand (stick with the two cards they have). The player can also choose to double down (double their bet and receive one more card) or split (split their hand into two separate hands, each with one card).
