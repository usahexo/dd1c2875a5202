#  How to Block Gambling Websites on Your Own Computer 

There are several different methods you can use to block gambling websites on your computer. In this article, we will show you how to do it using two different methods: software and hardware.

## Method 1: Software

The first method is to use software to block gambling websites. This can be done in a few different ways. One way is to use a program like Betfilter, which is designed specifically for blocking gambling websites. Another way is to use a general purpose internet filter like Parental Controls or Covenant Eyes. Both of these programs can be used to block specific websites or categories of websites.

If you are using a program like Betfilter, you will need to configure it to block the websites that you want blocked. This process will vary depending on the program you are using, but generally, you will need to add the website addresses or web domains that you want blocked to a list in the program.

If you are using a general purpose internet filter, the process for blocking gambling websites will be similar, but the configuration options may be a bit different. You will likely need to create a custom filter profile that blocks gambling websites, and then add the website addresses or web domains that you want blocked to that profile.

Once you have set up the software to block gambling websites, it will automatically block them whenever they are accessed from your computer. This can help protect you from online gambling addiction and keep you from spending money on harmful and addictive games.

## Method 2: Hardware

The second method for blocking gambling websites is to use hardware blockers. These devices are physical objects that connect between your computer and your internet connection and prevent access to certain types of websites. There are several different types of hardware blockers available, including filters, routers, and custom built devices.

One popular type of hardware blocker is called Gamblock. This is a small device that connects between your computer and your internet connection and blocks access to all known gambling websites. It also includes features that allow parents to control which computers in the house can access the internet and prevents anyone from accessing any other type of website except those that have been approved by the parent.

Another type of blocker is called Net Nanny. This is a router-based device that blocks access to certain types of websites based on their category or content rating. It can be used with any type of home network router and allows parents to selectively block access to specific types of content such as violence, pornography, and gambling sites.


 whichever method you choose, both software blockers 

  (Betfilter/Parental Controls) or hardware blockers (Gamblock/Net Nanny) offer an effective solution for helping manage problem gambling behavior by completely restricting access casino-style sites altogether

#  How to Block Gambling Websites on Your Android Phone or Tablet 

Almost all Android smartphones and tablets come with a built-in feature that allows you to block gambling websites. This guide will teach you how to use this feature to keep yourself and your family safe from the dangers of online gambling.

To start, open the Settings app on your Android device and tap on “Parental Controls”.

If this is your first time using Parental Controls, you will be prompted to create a new parental control profile. Tap “Create New Profile” and enter a name for the profile.

Next, scroll down until you see the section labeled “Web Filtering”. Tap on “Enable Web Filtering” and then select the desired level of protection. We recommend selecting the “Strict” level of filtering to ensure that no gambling websites can be accessed from your device.

Once you have enabled web filtering, tap on the “Gambling Websites” tab. Here, you will see a list of all the gambling websites that have been blocked by your Android device.

If you ever want to remove a website from the list, simply tap on it and then tap on the “Remove” button.

#  How to Block Gambling Websites from your Home Network 

There are many reasons why you might want to block gambling websites from your home network. Maybe you don't want your children exposed to the dangers of gambling, or maybe you yourself struggle with a gambling addiction and don't want to be tempted.

Fortunately, blocking gambling websites is a relatively easy task. In this article, we'll show you how to do it using the popular networking tool known as DD-WRT.

First, head over to the DD-WRT website and download the firmware for your specific router. Once you've downloaded it, open up the file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

Once DD-WRT is installed, open up your browser and navigate to '192.168.1.1'. This will take you to the DD-WRT dashboard. From here, click on 'Wireless' and then 'Wireless security'.

In the Wireless security section, make sure that 'WEP' is selected under 'Encryption type'. Then, set a password for your wireless network and hit save.

Next, scroll down to the 'Services' tab and click on 'VPN Passthrough'. Make sure that 'Enabled' is checked and hit save.

Finally, go back to the main page of the Dashboard and click on 'Firewall'. Under the ' basic settings ', make sure that 'Block WAN requests' is checked and hit save.

Your home network is now effectively blocked from accessing gambling websites.

#  How to Block Gambling Websites using a third party service

Gambling has been around for centuries and is a popular form of entertainment for many people. While there’s nothing wrong with occasional gambling, it can become a problem when it becomes an addiction. When someone is addicted to gambling, they will often gamble more and more money in order to try and win back what they lost. This can lead to financial problems, job loss, and even bankruptcy.

If you or someone you know is addicted to gambling, it’s important to get help. There are also steps you can take to protect yourself from gambling websites. One way to do this is by using a third party service that blocks access to these websites.

There are a few different services that offer this type of protection. One popular one is called Gamban. Gamban is a software service that blocks access to all online gambling websites. It’s available for both Mac and PC, and can be used with all major browsers.

Another service that offers similar protection is called Gamblingtherapy. This service is free to use and has a database of all known gambling websites. It also provides information on how to get help if you or someone you know has a gambling addiction.

If you’re looking for a way to block gambling websites on your phone or tablet, there are also some options available. One popular app that does this is called Betfilter. Betfilter blocks all known gambling websites on all devices running Android, iOS, Windows, or macOS. It also includes features like time limits, blocking certain games, and alerts when inappropriate content is detected.

While using a third party service like Gamban or Betfilter can be helpful in blocking gambling websites, it’s important to remember that they are not 100% effective. There may be ways around these filters if someone really wants to access a gambling website. If you are concerned about someone accessing these sites, it’s best to talk to them about the dangers of addiction and seek professional help if needed
