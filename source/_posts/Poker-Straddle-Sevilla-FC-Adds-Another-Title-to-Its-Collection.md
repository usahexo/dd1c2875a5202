#  Poker Straddle Sevilla FC Adds Another Title to Its Collection

The Sevilla FC football team is on a winning streak. After becoming the Spanish Super Cup champions in August, they have now won the European Poker Tour (EPT) Barcelona main event.

This latest win makes the Sevilla FC squad the only one in history to have simultaneously held three different international poker titles. They are now the EPT Champions, the Spanish Poker Masters Champions, and the WPT National Series Champions.

The Barcelona EPT event was a three-day tournament with 792 participants. The final table consisted of eight players, including two from Spain and six from other countries. It was eventually won by Ismael Bojang of Germany, who took home €547,000 in prize money.

Bojang had a strong showing throughout the tournament, consistently finishing in the top five places. He finally made it to first place after defeating Laurent Polito of France in a heads-up match. Polito took home €376,000 as runner-up prize money.

The Spanish players at the final table both finished in seventh place. Sergio Aido Gomez was eliminated first, followed by Adrian Mateos Diaz just minutes later.

The victory by Ismael Bojang marks the second time a German player has won an EPT main event; the first being Max Heinzelmann back in 2013. This is also Bojang’s largest career win to date.

Sevilla FC’s successful poker players are helping to put their team on the map of international competitive sports teams. In addition to their three recent poker titles, they also became Europa League champions in 2016 and 2007 and World Cup winners in 2006.

#  Poker Straddle Sevilla FC Dominates La Liga Yet Again

The newly crowned Spanish champions Sevilla FC looked like they were playing a different game than the rest of the La Liga clubs this season. They easily took home the title, their third in a row and fifth in the last seven seasons. Some might say that their style of play is boring and doesn't provide enough excitement for fans, but there is no doubt that they are a very effective and well-oiled machine.

One of the keys to their success this season was their use of the "poker straddle." This is a strategy that was pioneered by Sevilla head coach Unai Emery, who learned it from his time coaching in Qatar. It involves putting your striker up front as an extra midfielder, which gives you more control over the game and allows you to take more risks.

This stratgey proved to be extremely effective against teams that like to sit back and defend. Sevilla would simply straddle their striker up front, taking away space and forcing the other team to react. This would then create gaps in their defense that Sevilla's attacking midfielders could exploit.

As Emery explained after one game: "With (the) straddle we are looking for superiority in midfield. With five midfielders we can have ball possession and provoke the opponent."

And provoke they did! Sevilla dominated most of their games this season, scoring some impressive goals in the process. Their final tally of 84 points was 14 more than second-place Barcelona and 25 more than Real Madrid, who finished in third place.

It will be interesting to see how other La Liga clubs adapt to Sevilla's unique style of play next season. But for now, it is clear that they are still the kings of Spanish football.
