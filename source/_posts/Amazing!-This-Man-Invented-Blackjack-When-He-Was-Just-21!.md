#  Amazing! This Man Invented Blackjack When He Was Just 21!

Most people know that Blackjack is a popular casino game that involves betting and drawing cards in order to get as close to 21 without going over. But what many people don’t know is that the game was actually invented by a man named John Scarne when he was just 21 years old!

Scarne was born in 1903 and grew up in New York City. He started out as a magician, but he soon became interested in card games. He began developing his own version of Blackjack, which eventually became the most popular casino game in the world.

Scarne was also a prolific author and wrote dozens of books on card games, magic, and other topics. He died in 1985, but his legacy lives on in the popular game that bears his name.

In 1969, a young and unknown inventor named Kevin Black came up with an idea that would forever change the gambling industry. Black’s invention was a computerized system that could accurately predict the outcome of any given game of chance. With his new invention, Black quickly gained notoriety in the gambling world and soon became one of its most successful players.

Black’s success was not without its detractors, however. Many casino owners and operators saw his invention as a threat to their businesses and did everything they could to try and stop him. Despite their efforts, Black continued to win big at the casinos, often taking home staggering sums of money.

In 1973, Black finally put his critics to rest when he won the prestigious World Series of Gambling by correctly predicting the outcome of 21 consecutive games of chance. With his incredible feat, Black solidified his status as one of the greatest gambling minds of all time.
