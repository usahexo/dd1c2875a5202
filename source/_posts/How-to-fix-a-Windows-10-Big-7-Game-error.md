There are various reasons why a Windows 10 game might crash. In this article, we will explore some of the most common causes and offer solutions on how to fix them.

Games crashing is one of the most common issues with Windows 10. There are various reasons for this problem, but fortunately, there are also ways to fix it. In this article, we will walk you through a few methods that might help you resolve the issue.

First, let’s take a look at some of the things you can do to prevent games from crashing in Windows 10.

1) Make sure your system meets the game requirements

Some games require specific hardware or software in order to run properly. Before purchasing and installing a game, be sure to check the system requirements on the game’s website or store page. If your system doesn’t meet the requirements, the game is likely to crash.

2) Keep your device drivers up to date

In many cases, outdated device drivers can cause games to crash. To ensure that your drivers are up to date, use either Device Manager or a third-party driver updater tool.

3) Close background programs before playing games

Many times, running too many programs at once can cause games to crash. Close any unnecessary background programs before launching a game. This includes programs such as anti-virus software, instant messaging apps, and web browsers.

4) Install any available game updates

If there are any updates available for your game, be sure to install them. Updates often include bug fixes and performance enhancements that can help reduce crashes. To check for updates, open the game’s main menu and look for an “Update” or “Download” button.

5) Lower your graphics settings if needed

Graphics settings that are too high for your system can cause games to crash. If you experience regular crashes while playing a particular game, try lowering your graphics settings and see if that reduces the frequency of crashes. You can usually find graphics settings options in the game’s main menu or options screen.
